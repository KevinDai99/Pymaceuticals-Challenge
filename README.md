# Pymaceuticals-Challenge

In this Challenge I cleaned and analyzed data on different drug regimens and its effect on tumor volume

### Observations and Insights 
----

1) There is a high correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume. Perhaps this needs to be normalized when comparing the effectivness of drug regimens. 

2) The Treatment of Capomulin was able to decrease the total tumor volume. However, this needs to be compared against a control, and statistical significance demonstrated. 

3) Out of the 4 drug regimens explored ["Capomulin", "Ramicane", "Infubinol", "Ceftamin"]:

* Capomulin and Ramicane seem to reduce tumor volume more than Infubinol and Ceftamin.
